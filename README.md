# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables are a place to store information and are given a name and a value. Variables can be one of several data types, including string, number, and boolean.
	* Strings are a type of variable that consist of any series of characters encapsulated by single or double quotes. 
	* Functions are blocks of code that are accessible from elsewhere in the same scope of code. When called by their given name, they accept a set of defined arguments, or variables. These functions then do work with their arguments and then `return` some data. This data is then transported to where their function was first called.
	* An `if (conditional)` statement is a defined block of code that only executes when its conditional is `true`.
	* A boolean is a type of variable that is either `true` or `false`, and is at the center of conditionals.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
